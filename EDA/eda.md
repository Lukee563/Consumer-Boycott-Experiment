# Exploratory Data Analysis


## Research Questions:

-   Are individuals willing to buy from a more expensive seller if the
    seller is considered ethical compared to an unethical seller
    offering the same good at a cheaper price?

-   Do individuals respond to the injuctive norm (a social standard that
    dictates what people believe others approve of or expect them to
    do)?

## Analysis Objective:

-   Using data collected from an experimental pilot session hosted by
    LEEPS @ UC Santa Cruz on June 4th, 2025, we hope to identify early
    conclusions to our proposed research questions. Our sample size of
    24 and the preliminary nature of this experiment prevent us from
    establishing causal claims, however, early conclusions to these
    research questions may guide later iterations of the Consumer
    Boycott experiment.
